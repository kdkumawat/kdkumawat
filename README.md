- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kuldeep Kumawat

With over 10+ years of experience as a software engineer, I have had the opportunity to work across multiple domains, including FinTech, SSO with Active Directory, E-Commerce, and Social Networking. I pride myself on my ability to adapt to different environments and quickly learn new technologies to create efficient solutions.

Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in building products from end-to-end. My technical expertise includes GoLang, gRPC, protobuf, SQL, MongoDb, Redis, C#, Micro-services, Docker, AWS, .Net Core, Electron, Angular, Vue.js, JQuery, and Javascript, which allows me to build scalable and performant systems that meet business needs.

Hands on experience - WebRTC, Datadog, logstash, kafka, OS Internals (Mac / Windows / Linux)

A typical day in my work routine involves various activities, such as requirement gathering and analysis, database design, coding, UI design, unit testing, code review, deployment, documentation, and mentoring. I approach each task with a detail-oriented mindset and a dedication to delivering quality work.
